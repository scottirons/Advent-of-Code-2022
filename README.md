# Advent-of-Code-2022

Working on the puzzles to both learn new languages and build existing skills.

Language: goals

C++: Learn, utilize standard library and modern functionality as much as possible

Rust: Learn and become comfortable with unfamiliar syntax

C: Learn and become comfortable with manipulating strings. Hopefully get more comfortable with error handling, too

Python: Continue to improve my skills and do things in Pythonic ways

Something else??: Half of Day 4 in x86 assembly, hosted in this repository for organization's sake: https://github.com/scottirons/advent-of-code-asm
