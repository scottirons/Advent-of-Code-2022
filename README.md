# Advent-of-Code-2022

Working on the puzzles to both learn new languages and build existing skills.

Language: goals

Rust: Learn and become comfortable with unfamiliar syntax \n
C: Learn and become comfortable with manipulating strings. Hopefully get more comfortable with error handling, too \n
Python: Continue to improve my skills and do things in Pythonic ways \n
C++: Learn, utilize standard library and modern functionality as much as possible \n
Something else??: TBD ;)
